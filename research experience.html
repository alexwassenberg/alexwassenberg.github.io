			    As NASA moves forward toward carrying out manned missions to Mars and other destinations requiring long-duration 
				space travel, a crucial consideration is the provision of proper medical care in reduced gravity environments 
				where Earth-based resources and timely communications with Earth can no longer be depended on for medical 
				support. The Exploration Medical Capability (ExMC) element of the NASA's Human Research Program (HRP) has been 
				charged with developing a medical workstation specialized for long-duration space missions.<br>
				<br>In order to support the ExMC element, I gathered information on gaps associated with the development of the 
				interior volume and layout of a long-duration habitat medical workstation. Using currently 
				available resources, including NASA documents and discussion with subject matter experts (SMEs),
				I identified medical conditions that will likely occur on long-duration space missions, the equipment and supplies 
				(and their associated technical specifications) required to treat these conditions, and the human factors that must 
				be taken into consideration for effective treatment and utilization of the workstation. I used these factors to develop
				a preliminary design of a medical workstation, modeled in PTC Creo. This proccess led to the development of novel layouts 
				and design features. Additionally, during the design process, gaps in knowledge and additionalresearch necessary for 
				the complete development of a medical unit were also identified. From the recognition of these gaps, new areas of 
				research which need to be carried out by ExMC in addition to design features that can be further researched 
				were identified. </p>

				<p style="text-align:justify; padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;"> <img src="aether.JPG" style="float:left; padding-right:25px; width:500px; height:auto;">
				I conducted research in order to characterize the humidity removal performance of a regenerable silica gel desiccant 
				bed. The results of this research would be used to determine the optimal desorption temperature for spacecraft atmosphere revitalization 
				applications. <br>
				<br> I designed the testing procedure for the research project which utilized the CU Boulder Bioastronautics 
				Labâ€™s atmosphere revitalization rig designed to supply a customized atmosphere to test articles. Since the rig was developed by 
				another research group within the Bioastronautics Lab, I had to interface closely with the group in order to ensure that the 
				rig was being utilized properly and in such a way as to satisfy the research requirements for the experiment. The rig was used to pass air of a monitored and 
				regulated pressure, composition, and flow rate 
				through a test article containing silica gel. A rope heater wrapped around the 
				test article was used to heat the gel, and a custom LabView program collected temperature data from thermocouples 
				spot-welded along the length of the test article.

				<p style="text-align:left; padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;"> <font size="5"> Electrode Development for Ion Electrospray Propulsion Systems </font> </p>
				<p style="text-align:justify; padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;"> <img src="solgel.JPG" style="float:left; padding-right:25px; width:500px; height:auto;"> 
				Through this research, I fabricated materials to be used as high performance electrodes in ion electrospray 
				propulsion systems. Specifically, I used the novel one-step sol-gel process to rapidly and inexpensively grow and 
				cast porous ceramics at low temperatures. I successfully fabricated alumina microtips with highly uniform and tailorable 
				porosities to serve as ion emitters. Under test firing, the lab-grown alumina was able to achieve current outputs per 
				applied voltage almost two order of magnitude greater than the material the lab had previously used, a costly polished 
				glass which required time-intensive laser machining to shape into desired structures. <br>
				<br>In September 2013, I presented my research at the 2013 Clean Energy, Education, and Empowerment (C3E) Women in Clean Energy Symposium hosted at MIT in conjunction with 
				US C3E Program led by the US Department of Energy.   </p>
