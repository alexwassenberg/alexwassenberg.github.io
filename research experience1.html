				<b> Purpose: </b> Worked in a team of 14 students to design and construct a reduced-scale prototype 
				Martian greenhouse sponsored by the NASA eXploration Habitat Academic 
				Innovation Challenge. The greenhouse was designed to be closed system that would autonomously monitor and control plant growth through 
				the regulation of lighting, nutrient and water provision, and atmospheric composition. </p>
				
				<p style="text-align:justify; padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;"> 
				<b> Role: </b> My responsibilities included work on the atmosphere regulation, structural, and electrical
				design teams. As a member of the <b> atmosphere regulation subsystem</b>, I worked on the design and 
				construction of the systems required to carry out carbon dioxide provision for plant growth, nitrogen provision to maintain
				to pressure in the growing volume, removal and separation of plant-produced oxygen, humidity control, trace contaminent 
				control, and ventilation. This work required the definition of subsystem requirements; development of mass, power, 
				volume, and cost budgets; writing and implementation of component and system integration test plans; communication with 
				vendors to identify and modify COTS components suitable for use in the system; hardware integration; and the development 
				of interface control documentation to specify the integration of the atmosphere regulation subsystem components with
				other subsystem components and the system structure.</p>
				
				<p style="text-align:justify; padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;"> As a member of the <b> structural design subsystem</b>, I worked
				on the design (in SolidWorks) and construction of an 80/20 framework that would enable the integration of all subsystem
				componenets and also provide a sealed growing volume to enable an isolated, customized atmosphere. </p>
				
				<p style="text-align:justify; padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;"> My work on the <b> electrical subsystem </b> included 
				the assembly of the support circuitry for the system's 35 sensors and wiring of the system. Additionally, I modeled the system PCB
				in Altium, completed PCB assembly, and integrated the PCB into the system.

				My first graduate project at CU Boulder involved the conceptual and reduced-scale prototype 
				design of an autonomous Martian greenhouse sponsored by the NASA eXploration Habitat Academic 
				Innovation Challenge. My specific roles in the team of 14 graduate students included work on 
				the atmospheric regulation and structural design teams. The conceptual greenhouse would be 
				deployed on the surface of Mars and plant growth initiated from a command center on Earth prior 
				to astronaut arrival. The greenhouse would autonomously monitor and control plant growth through 
				the regulation of lighting, nutrient and water provision, and atmospheric composition. Crops 
				and oxygen produced by the plants would then be available to the astronauts at the time of 
				their arrival to Mars.  The conceptual design also incorporated the use of in-situ resources. 
				Carbon dioxide would be pulled from the Martian atmosphere and supplied to the plants, and a 
				hybrid lighting system would be employed, consisting of the use of both internal LEDs during 
				periods of darkness (nighttime or dust storms) and natural light, when available, via a clear 
				upper dome. Key design features of the atmospheric regulation system included humidity control, 
				ventilation, trace contaminant control, use of carbon dioxide from the Martian atmosphere, and 
				separation and storage of plant-produced oxygen using regenerable molecular sieve technology. 
				Key design features of the conceptual greenhouse structure include a clamshell lid that would 
				open to allow in sunlight through the clear, upper dome and close during dust storms to prevent 
				dust accumulation on the dome and night for thermal protection. Additionally, the greenhouse 
				would sit on an inflatable ring that would lift the greenhouse off of the cold ground and serve 
				as storage for excess oxygen produced by the plants. </p>
